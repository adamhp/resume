{XOR Security}{(Remote) Falls Church, VA}
{Staff Software Engineer}{June 2015 -- Present}

\vspace{8pt}
\resumeSubSubheading{Senior Data Scientist \& Solutions Architect}{March 2022 -- Present}{CISA, Integrated Operations Division}
\resumeItemListStart
\item Architected and implemented an agency-wide Common Operating Picture (COP)—a centralized geospatial dashboard and supporting services—for data collection, storage, analytics, and reporting of tens of thousands of critical infrastructure incidents, resulting in improved mission effectiveness for the agency and its leaders.
\item Leveraged existing tools (M365 \& Power Platform) to build a deployment tracking solution with no net-new material cost to track thousands of CISA personnel, briefed directly to the Deputy Director and other Division directors, which enhanced situational awareness, decision making, and resource allocation during critical incidents.
\item Automated several reports and business processes, resulting in improved report quality, and consistency, and reduced delivery time by over 50\%, freeing up Watch analysts to focus on higher-value tasks.
